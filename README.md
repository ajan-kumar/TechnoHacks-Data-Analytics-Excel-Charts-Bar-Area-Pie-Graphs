## Task
Creating Charts in Excel! This task was all about transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations using different chart types.

## Here's what I accomplished:
- Dataset Selection: I used "Inventory Record Dataset" from Task 1, packed with various metrics and categories.
- Chart Creation: I crafted four stunning charts:
  1. Combination Chart (Bar Chart & Line Chart): Combines bar and line charts to show both categorical data- "Sales Vs Profit Per Product" for a comprehensive view. 
  2. Pie Chart: Visualizes the proportion of "Sales of every Product" within a whole dataset, perfect for quick insights.
  3. Area Chart: Displays data- "Profit Against Total Sales Made" in filled areas, ideal for showing cumulative totals and comparing magnitudes. 
  4. Bar Chart: Facilitates comparisons of different categories- "Units Sold & Closing Stock" with clear, discrete data points.
- Analysis: Each chart is clearly labeled, and I provided a brief analysis of what they represent, highlighting key insights and trends. 
- Tools Used: Microsoft Excel
